## Version 1 - Week 14: Working with Lists in REACT (MIT XPro, July 2021)

# Description

This is a basic "To-Do List".  Using css grids and a background image, I've replicated a simple to do list with the functionality of adding and deleting a to-do item. # How to Run

1) Fork the "To-Do-List" repository
2) Clone onto your machine using Git
3) Drag and drop "todo.html" into a new tab
4) Innovate it and teach us what you did and how you did it!!!

P.S. Please do not forget to register to MapBox in order to get an API key....
